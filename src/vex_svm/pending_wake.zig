//! Pure WAKE-decision predicate for CHAIN-DEFER `pending_chain` entries.
//!
//! Extracted from `replay_stage.zig:checkPendingChain` so the wake gate — the
//! decision that re-drives a deferred child slot once its parent situation
//! changes — is PROVEN by unit test, not reasoned-correct in place. This is the
//! advisor-mandated discriminator before the orphan-repair FETCH fix
//! (2026-05-30): the live stalled validator shows frozen_set=116 stable, root
//! pinned, 9009 pending, 0 CHAIN-WAKE — consistent with FETCH-blocked (parents
//! never fetched, so never frozen, so the wake never fires). This test confirms
//! the wake logic itself is correct, i.e. the moment a parent IS fetched and
//! frozen, its deferred child DOES wake — so FETCH alone is the missing piece.
//!
//! A child slot S is deferred keyed on its `target_parent` P (the parent it is
//! waiting to become replayable). `checkPendingChain` wakes S when ANY of three
//! Agave-canonical conditions holds:
//!   (a) P just froze this tick           `tp == frozen_slot`
//!   (b) P is at or below root            `root_slot > 0 and tp <= root_slot`
//!        (d27z: d21 falls back to root_bank as the parent in that case)
//!   (c) P is anywhere in the frozen set  `frozen_set.contains(tp)`
//!        (PR-S5: Agave generate_new_bank_forks semantics — independent of the
//!         ordering between the defer event and the parent's freeze event)
//!
//! Imports only std → unit-testable standalone (`zig build test-pending-wake`).
